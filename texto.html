<h2>Unraveling Environmental Noise</h2>
<p>Atmospheric pollution is not the only invisible threat that is harmful to our daily life. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
    <strong>noise pollution</strong> is one of the environmental factors that causes the most health problems.
</p>

<p>
    Excessive noise seriously harms human health and interferes with people's daily activities at school, at work, at home, and during leisure time. 
    It can disturb sleep, cause cardiovascular and psychophysiological effects, reduce performance, and provoke annoyance responses and changes in social behaviour.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.who.int/en">WHO</a> guidelines for community noise recommend less than 30 A-weighted decibels (dB(A)) in bedrooms during the night for a sleep of good quality and less than 35 dB(A) 
    in classrooms to allow good teaching and learning conditions.
</p>

<p>
    Some groups are more vulnerable to noise. As children spend more time in bed than adults, they are more exposed to night noise. Chronically ill and elderly people are more 
    sensitive to disturbance. Shift workers are at increased risk because their sleep structure is under stress. In addition, the less affluent who cannot afford to live in quiet 
    residential areas or have adequately insulated homes, are likely to suffer disproportionately.
</p>

<p>
    Nuisance at night can lead to an increase in medical visits and spending on sleeping pills, which affects families' budgets and countries' health expenditures. 
    The gap between rich and poor is likely to increase if governments fail to address noise pollution.
</p>

<p>According to a study made by <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/mortgages/noisiest-cities">Money.co.uk</a>, <strong>Madrid</strong> is the fourth loudest city in Europe.</p>

<p>The measures are in A-weighted decibels (dBA), which are an expression of the relative loudness of sounds in the air as perceived by the human ear. Therefore, low and very high frequencies are 
    given less weight than on the standard decibel scale. Many regulatory noise limits are specified in terms of dBA, based on the belief that dBA is better correlated with the relative risk of noise-induced hearing loss. For the analysis,
 the following measures will be used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ld</strong>: A-weighted long-term average sound level, determined over all day periods of the month from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</li>
    <li><strong>Le</strong>: A-weighted long-term average sound level, determined over all day periods of the month from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m.</li>
    <li><strong>Ln</strong>: A-weighted long-term average sound level, determined over all day periods of the month from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.</li>
    <li><strong>LAeq24</strong>: A-weighted long-term average sound level determined over all daily (24-hour) periods of the month.</li>
</ul>

    
<p>In the following map, all the active measurement stations are shown. Notice some of them will not appear because they have been dismissed for works and reforms such as <i>Plaza Espa√±a</i>.</it></p>
